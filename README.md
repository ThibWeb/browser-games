# Browser Games
===============

A group of little games / experiments running in the browser : either with Canvas, WebGL or by manipulating the DOM.

## Canvas Snake

Taken from a [CSS Tricks guest post](http://css-tricks.com/learn-canvas-snake-game/) by [Nick Morgan aka Skilldrick](http://skilldrick.co.uk/). Introduces the Canvas API and basic game structures (game loop, collision detection).

## FPS meter

A homemade FPS meter. For a real one, see [this repository](https://github.com/Darsain/fpsmeter).

## Pixi.js sprites

Trying out the [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) animation framework.

## Letterpaint

Concept taken in [this tutorial](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/building-a-simple-paint-game-with-html5-canvas-and-vanilla-javascript/) by [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/). Another approach at the Canvas API, well suited for mobile devices.

## JS Platformer

Another implementation of [this game](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tiny-platformer) by Jake Gordon. Great game physics !

## JS Hero

Original game engine / experiment by [Inline Block](https://github.com/inlineblock/javascript-hero).
